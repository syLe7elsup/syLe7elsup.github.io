I am a first-year Ph.D. student from Applied Mathematics and Statistics department, Johns Hopkins Univeristy. I am very fortunated to be advised by Prof. Benjamine Grimmer (https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~grimmer/) from the same instituition. 

Research Interest
======
Optimization Algorithms, Mathematical Programming, Stochastic Systems, Machine Learning

My research interest lies in the development of optimization algorithms. My current research focuses on proving theories and designing algorithms for minimizing non-smooth, non-convex functions. I am also interested in the study of stochastic optimization and the applications of machine learning.
